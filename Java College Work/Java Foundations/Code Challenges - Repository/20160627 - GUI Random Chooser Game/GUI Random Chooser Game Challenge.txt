Challenge:
Create a GUI program which will have 3 TextFields
and one button.

You will also have an Array of char containing
a bunch of values Example : {'A', '7', '1', 'B', 'C'};

The button will be located below the 3 TextFields
and when pressed it will populate the 3 Fields
with random values from the Array. If the values
match the pattern you want it to 
for example '7' '7' '7' would be the jackpot. 
You can make a pop-up window or a label tell the
user that they have won. 

You can add in different values for the different matches.

Warning: Think about the design before coding.
