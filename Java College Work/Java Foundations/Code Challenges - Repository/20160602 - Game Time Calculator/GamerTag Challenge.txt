The Challenge!

Create a program called GameTimeCalc.
This program will ask a user to input
their gamertag/username followed by their
favourite game. After getting these two 
pieces of information you then ask the 
user to input how many hours a year they
play the game.

Then calculate how many hours per week
and per day that works out to. Print out
the information to the user cleanly.

If you're dnoe - try to upgrade your program to use double 
instead of int, for a more accurate representation of the times.
This way we can have 1.5hrs instead of rounding 1.
