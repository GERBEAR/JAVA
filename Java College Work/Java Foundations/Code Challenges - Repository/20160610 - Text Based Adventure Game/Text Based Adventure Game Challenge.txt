The Challenge:

Your challenge is to design a text based adventure game. 
First you will ask the user to enter their character name,
next you will ask them to choose from a list of 
characters.(paladin/warlock/mage/hunter/warrior) etc.etc.
Each class has different health values.

Throughout the adventure you will present the user with
different decisions. For example :
"You have woken up in a dark dungeon, you see a shimmer
of a light shining from a small window to your left, and
what looks like a door to the right."
"Do you:
A: Walk to the window"
B: Walk to the door"
C: Stay where you are"

Then if they walk to the window you can say they find some fresh
fruit which they can reach from the window so +10 health.
However if they stay where they are, they could get bitten by a rat
meaning -20 health. Keep giving decision until they die, or survive.
